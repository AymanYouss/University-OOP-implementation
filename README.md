# University OOP Implementation

This Python project implements a grading system for a university using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing university-related tasks.

## Overview

The main components of the project are organized in a Jupyter Notebook:

- **OOP project final.ipynb:** A notebook containing multiple cells, each representing a particular class. Refer to the documentation within the notebook for a full understanding of the class design.

Additionally, a visual representation of the project can be found in the UML diagram:

- **Univeristy management system diagram .pdf:** The UML diagram illustrating the structure of the university management system.

## Getting Started

To explore and understand the classes and their interactions:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/University-OOP-implementation.git`
2. Open and review the `OOP project final.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## UML Diagram

The UML diagram provides a visual representation of the project's structure. Refer to the `Univeristy management system diagram .pdf` file for insights into class relationships and the overall system design.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on each class and their design, refer to the `OOP project final.ipynb` notebook. Each cell in the notebook corresponds to a specific class, providing insights into their functionality and purpose.
